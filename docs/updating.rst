Updating Your Package
=====================

Once you have setup your project there will come a time when some things in the
package template change, new versions of ``astropy_helpers`` or updates to the
infrastructure you want to utilise. Updating your package with these changes is
a balance between maintaining parity with the original template and customising
your project to your needs.
